	<h1>About Me</h1>
	</div>
		<p>I am a rising junior at New York University. I am studying computer science and hope to be a software 
		engineer. I was born in NYC but grewup in Southampton NY. </p>

	<h1>My Mission</h1>
	</div>
		<p>I wanted to create a blog that shows my personal creativity and where I gain inspiration from. I think a lot of what has shaped me as a person has been my traveling experiences. Being exposed to different cultures and the way people live differently around the world has definitely shaped my view of myself, what values I want to live by, and how I view the outside world. Traveling has also shaped my fashion sense drastically, which is another large part of my self identity. I believe you can dictate the way other people view you based on how you carry yourself.   And, choice of style, at least for me, is a large part of how I carry myself. I like to wear clothes that I feel confident in, and the fashion portion of this. It will show where I draw my inspiration, and there will also be a portion on how I am able to buy nice clothes without completely killing my budget. The traveling portion will be the same, displaying my favorite places and how they have shaped me, a guide to how to travel without spending too much money, and a portion about places I want to visit and why. I think this website will resonate with people who share a similar love for fashion and travel. It will also hopefully help those who aspire to see the world that donâ€™t want to spend all of there money. </p>
